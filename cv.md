### About Myself

I have learned web development for 2 years. It's slowly, but I have a reason. I spend most of my time raising a child.
In the remaining time I study web technologies. I started with Python backend development. Now I'm learning frontend.
I am interested in web development. I am full of desire and enthusiasm, and I plan to look for a job in the future.

### Code example

###### 1. Python

Polish calculator.

```
OPERATIONS = {
    '+': lambda a, b: a + b,
    '-': lambda a, b: a - b,
    '*': lambda a, b: a * b,
    '/': lambda a, b: a // b
}


class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.__items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if len(self.__items) == 0:
            return None
        return self.__items.pop()


def polish_calc(input_list):
    stack = Stack()
    for element in input_list:
        if element in OPERATIONS:
            operand1, operand2 = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
            operation = OPERATIONS[element]
            res = operation(operand2, operand1)
            stack.push(res)
        else:
            stack.push(int(element))
    return stack.pop()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    polish_s = list(input().split())
    print(polish_calc(polish_s))
```



###### 2. JavaScript

Count cats!
Your task is to count the cats hidden in the backyard (presented by two-dimensional Array).
Cats hide well, but their ears ("^^") are clearly visible.
Your task is to implement the countCats(backyard) function that will count cats. Good luck!

Number of cats found should be number. If no cats found, function should return 0.

For example:

`countCats([ [0, 1, '^^'], [0, '^^', 2], ['^^', 1, 2] ]) => 3`

```
function countCats(backyard) {
  const result = backyard.reduce(function(intermediateResult, area) {  
  
  const preResult = area.reduce(function(previousValue, section) {  
    if (section === '^^') {  
      previousValue += 1;  
    }  
    return previousValue;  
  }, 0);  
  intermediateResult += preResult;  
  return intermediateResult;  
  }, 0);  
  return result;
}
```
